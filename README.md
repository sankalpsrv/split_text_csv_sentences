# split_text_into_sentences
Split text into sentences

Uses a set of regex expressions to partition complex narrative into sentences. 

Forked from [gurganious's repo](https://github.com/gurganious/split_text_into_sentences)

# How to use

The Python program at src/main.py can be used to generate a CSV file from the sentences with the prompt for location/name of the file.

The CSV file generated has the same name as the txt file, except for the extension.
